# Discrete Fourier transform

## Repository description

This repository contains code related to the Discrete Fourier Transform course by Mike X. Cohen on Udemy:

[Master the Fourier transform and its applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/fourier-transform-mxc)

The majority of the "base" code is adapted from material developed by the course instructor. I have made minor modifications to experiment with it. The "FT exercises" files contain more of my own contributions, where I added creative input beyond the provided material.
